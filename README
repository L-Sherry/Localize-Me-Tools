These tools help to create translations for use by Localize-Me
The dependencies are Python 3 with pycrypto.

These are currently incomplete, but you may already do the following:

- Decrypt one or multiple pack files:
(you may need to add --from-locale=de_DE if e.g. the translation is made from
 the de_DE locale instead of the default en_US)

./packfile.py --game-dir location/of/original/game decrapt encrapted_pack.json decrapted_pack.json
or
./packfile.py --game-dir location/of/original/game decrapt encrapted_pack_dir/ decrapted_pack_dir/

- Encrypt (with weak crypto) one or multiple pack files.  This is optional,
  but this is a way to not distribute the entire original copyrighted text
  as part of your translation.

./packfile.py --game-dir location/of/original/game encrapt my_pack.json encrapted.json
or
./packfile.py --game-dir location/of/original/game encrapt my_dir/ encrapted_dir/

- Merge multiple pack files into one, for easier editing:

./packfile merge my_pack_dir/ my_resulting_big_pack_file.json

- Create a map file from a big pack file, so you can split a big pack file into
  several, then actually split the big pack file

./packfile.py --map-file my-map-file.json mkmap my_big_pack_file.json
(you may customize my-map-file.json now...)
./packfile.py --map-file my-map-file.json split my_big_pack_file.json output_directory

- Diff two langfiles to create a pack file.
  (This only work for lang files, i.e. files under data/lang/)
./packfile.py difflang original/lang.en_US.json translated/lang.es_ES.json resulting_packfile.json
